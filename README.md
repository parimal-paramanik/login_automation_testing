Introduction
In the continuum of improvement, introspection holds paramount significance. This documentation immerses itself in the realm of automated testing, employing TestCafe, to scrutinize the SDLMS login process. The practice of automated testing not only unveils insights into system behavior but also identifies latent issues, guaranteeing an unblemished user experience.

Testing Approach
The testing methodology adopts an automated approach, harnessing the prowess of TestCafe, to script interactions mirroring user actions during the login process. This rigorous validation ensures the veracity of the login functionality, preemptively identifying and mitigating potential anomalies during the development lifecycle.

Test Cases
Valid Login
Input a valid username and password.
Initiate login by clicking the login button.
Validate successful login by confirming the presence of the dashboard logo.
Invalid Login
Input an invalid username and password.
Initiate login by clicking the login button.
Confirm the display of an error alert, featuring a dismissal button.
Challenges Faced
The testing journey was unimpeded by significant challenges. The TestCafe framework adeptly facilitated the seamless automation of login tests, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.
